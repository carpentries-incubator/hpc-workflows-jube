# Summary

This course provides an introduction into the JÃ¼lich Benchmarking Environment (JUBE), a workflow management system created for running performance benchmarks on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. JUBE can also be used for general workflows involving running applications on HPC systems, and this course will further provide an example on how to run the molecular-dynamic code GROMACS and will discuss aspects of workflow reproducibility in JUBE.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

This lesson is still under construction and will likely change abrubtly and
frequently---please be patient.

If you are looking for an introduction to the JÃ¼lich Benchmarking Environment
(JUBE) in the meantime, feel free to head over to the [
JUBE tutorial pages of the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre][jube-tutorial].
