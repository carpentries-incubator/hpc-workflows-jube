:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I improve reproducibility of my JUBE workflow?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify key aspects of the workflow and its parameters.
- Define ways to record values of these aspects as part of a run.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

JUBE in itself does **not** make every workflow definition inherently reproducible.
However, all parts of a workflow definition and parameter evaluation are recorded and retained during workflow execution.
To increase reproducibility of a workflow, it's the user's repsonsibility to identify all aspects of a workflow and define ways to record them during execution of the workflow.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Which aspects of the build and measurement steps should be recorded to increase reproducibility of the workflow?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::: hint

Potential aspects that merit recording:

- For general workflow execution
  - Build flags used to generate binaries
  - Versions of software and libraries used
  - Input files and configuration
  - Output files
  - Execution scale and domain decomposition
  - ...
- For performance measurements (additionally to the ones above)
  - Networking libraries involved
  - Configuration of networking library
  - Processor model and microcode version
  - OS and kernel version
  - Node names used for the execution
  - Execution configuration (pinning, distribution, ...)
  - ...

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
Select one or more of the aspects identified in the prior discussion and specify a configuration to record it as part of a workflow.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::: hint

Here are some examples on how to record some reproducibility-relevant aspacts of your workflow

- Build flags can either be specified directly or tried to be extracted from generated build files (e.g., Makefiles)
- Versions of software and dependent librariess should be a mix of specified and extracted
  - **Note**: It can be difficult to identify the corresponding versions of linked libraries if they didn't record this information
- Output files are a natural part of the run directory
- Scale and specifics of execution can easily be defined as a parameter and used to generate input and run files
- Network libraries are commonly part of the system's software stack and notoriously hard to identify on the low level
  - **Note**: It is easy to record the version of a selected MPI library, while it may be harder to identify the built-time configuration of a pre-installed system library
  - **Note**: Generate software environments (e.g., docker or apptainer images) to help conserve the execution environments
- OS and kernel version can be recorded from commands like `uname` or files in `/proc`
  - **Note**: Make sure to record this information from the correct location (login nodes vs. batch nodes)
- Node names can be gathered after execution with scheduler tools and the JOB ID (extracted from submission output)
- Execution confguration such as pinning should be explicitly set and checked for validity
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- **Identify aspects** of the workflow that are important for reproducibility.
- Obtain values for these either through **parameters** or **patterns**.
- **Add actions** to the workflow that help in recording information through
  patterns.
